- **Server Actions**: Form submissions and mutations

---

## 🗄️ Data Storage Architecture

### **1. Supabase Authentication (`auth.users`)**
**What's Stored:**
- User email and encrypted password
- User metadata (role, full_name, student_id, department, year_of_study)
- Authentication tokens and session data

**How It Works:**
- Managed entirely by Supabase Auth
- JWT tokens contain user metadata for role-based access
- Automatic session management and token refresh

---

### **2. PostgreSQL Database Tables**

#### **`profiles` Table**
\`\`\`sql
Columns:
- id (UUID, Primary Key) → References auth.users(id)
- role (TEXT) → 'student' or 'admin'
- full_name (TEXT)
- student_id (TEXT, unique for students)
- department (TEXT)
- year_of_study (INTEGER, for students)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
\`\`\`
**Purpose:** Extended user profile information beyond basic auth data

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can view and update their own profile
- Admins can view all profiles (checked via JWT role)

---

#### **`achievements` Table**
\`\`\`sql
Columns:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- name (TEXT) → e.g., "First Class with Distinction"
- category (TEXT) → 'academic', 'sports', 'cultural', etc.
- description (TEXT)
- max_points (INTEGER) → Maximum merit points for this achievement
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
\`\`\`
**Purpose:** Defines available achievement types and their point values

**RLS Policies:**
- Everyone can read achievements
- Only admins can create/update/delete achievements

---

#### **`submissions` Table**
\`\`\`sql
Columns:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- student_id (UUID) → Foreign Key to profiles(id)
- achievement_id (UUID) → Foreign Key to achievements(id)
- description (TEXT) → Student's description of achievement
- proof_url (TEXT) → URL to uploaded proof document in Storage
- points_awarded (INTEGER) → Actual points given by admin
- status (TEXT) → 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- reviewed_by (UUID, nullable) → Foreign Key to profiles(id) - admin who reviewed
- reviewed_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
- admin_notes (TEXT, nullable)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
\`\`\`
**Purpose:** Stores student achievement submissions with review status

**RLS Policies:**
- Students can create submissions and view only their own
- Admins can view all submissions and update them (approve/reject)

---

#### **`merit_evaluations` Table**
\`\`\`sql
Columns:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- student_id (UUID) → Foreign Key to profiles(id)
- total_points (INTEGER) → Sum of all approved submission points
- rank (INTEGER) → Student's rank based on total points
- evaluation_date (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
\`\`\`
**Purpose:** Stores calculated merit scores and rankings

**RLS Policies:**
- Students can view their own evaluation
- Admins can view all evaluations and create/update them

---

### **3. Supabase Storage**

#### **`achievement-proofs` Bucket**
**What's Stored:**
- PDF documents, images (JPG, PNG), and other proof files
- Organized by user ID: `{user_id}/{filename}`

**Storage Policies:**
- Students can upload files to their own folder (`{user_id}/`)
- Students can view/delete only their own files
- Admins can view all files
- Bucket is set to PUBLIC for easy URL access

**File Upload Flow:**
1. Student selects file in form
2. File uploaded to Supabase Storage via `supabase.storage.from('achievement-proofs').upload()`
3. Public URL generated and stored in `submissions.proof_url`
4. File accessible via URL for admin review

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### **Authentication Flow**

#### **Sign Up:**
1. User fills sign-up form (email, password, role, profile info)
2. `supabase.auth.signUp()` creates user in `auth.users`
3. User metadata (role, full_name, etc.) stored in `raw_user_meta_data`
4. Database trigger (`handle_new_user()`) automatically creates profile in `profiles` table
5. User redirected to sign-up success page (email verification required)

#### **Login:**
1. User enters email and password
2. `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` validates credentials
3. JWT token generated with user metadata (including role)
4. Token stored in cookies via middleware
5. User redirected based on role:
   - Student → `/dashboard`
   - Admin → `/admin`

#### **Session Management:**
1. Middleware (`middleware.ts`) runs on every request
2. Checks for valid session using `supabase.auth.getUser()`
3. Refreshes expired tokens automatically
4. Protects routes:
   - `/dashboard/*` → Students only
   - `/admin/*` → Admins only
   - `/auth/*` → Public (login/signup)

---

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**

**How It Works:**
- PostgreSQL policies enforce data access at database level
- Policies check `auth.uid()` (current user ID) and JWT claims
- Even if someone bypasses frontend, database blocks unauthorized access

**Example Policy:**
\`\`\`sql
-- Students can only view their own submissions
CREATE POLICY "Students can view own submissions"
  ON public.submissions FOR SELECT
  USING (student_id = auth.uid());

-- Admins can view all submissions
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all submissions"
  ON public.submissions FOR SELECT
  USING ((auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'role') = 'admin');
\`\`\`

## 📊 Data Flow Example

**Student Submits Achievement:**
\`\`\`
1. Student fills form in browser
2. File uploaded to Supabase Storage → Returns public URL
3. Server Action called with form data + file URL
4. Server Action inserts into submissions table:
   {
     student_id: auth.uid(),
     achievement_id: selected_achievement,
     description: "Won first prize...",
     proof_url: "https://supabase.co/storage/.../proof.pdf",
     status: "pending"
   }
5. RLS policy checks: Is student_id = auth.uid()? ✅ Allow
6. Record created in database
7. Student redirected to submissions page
8. Query fetches submissions WHERE student_id = auth.uid()
9. RLS policy allows (own data)
10. Submissions displayed in table
\`\`\`

**Admin Reviews Submission:**
\`\`\`
1. Admin opens review page
2. Query: SELECT * FROM submissions (all submissions)
3. RLS policy checks: Is user admin? (JWT role = 'admin') ✅ Allow
4. All submissions returned with student details (JOIN profiles)
5. Admin clicks "Approve" → Opens dialog
6. Admin enters points + notes → Submits
7. Server Action updates submission:
   {
     status: "approved",
     points_awarded: 50,
     reviewed_by: admin_id,
     reviewed_at: now(),
     admin_notes: "Excellent achievement"
   }
8. RLS policy checks: Is user admin? ✅ Allow UPDATE
9. Record updated
10. Student sees updated status in their dashboard
\`\`\`

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Email notifications (Supabase Edge Functions)
- Real-time submission updates (Supabase Realtime)
- Analytics dashboard for admins
- Bulk submission approval
- Export merit list to PDF/Excel
- Student achievement certificates generation
- Mobile app (React Native with same Supabase backend)

---

## 📝 Notes for Developers

- Always read files before editing (v0 requirement)
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- All database queries automatically protected by RLS
- Test with both student and admin accounts
- Check browser console for `[v0]` debug logs during development
- Storage bucket must be created manually (SQL scripts don't have permissions)
